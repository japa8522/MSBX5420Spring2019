## Errata

All problems:  when counting deaths, please use the `matchevents_df` table that we prepared
in HW Week 9.  Do NOT use the "kills" field from `playermatches_df`.  Also, don't try to do
any fancy filtering based on what caused the death (kill, suicide, impact, etc).  I wasn't
very sophisticated in my analysis.  To me "deadly" = "most deaths" (regardless of reason).

Problem 3 contains a typo.  Should read "where each pair contains the 
*map* name and total number of deaths that occurred in that map for the entire tournament."
